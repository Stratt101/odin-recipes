        <h1>Key Lime Pie</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            This key lime pie recipe is made with condensed milk and sour cream. 
            Fabulously easy and a summertime favorite! If you have time, a 
            homemade graham cracker crust is better. Garnish with whipped cream 
            and thin slices of lime if you like.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3 cups sweetened condensed milk</li>

            <li>¾ cup key lime juice</li>

            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon grated lime zest</li>

            <li>9 inch prepared graham cracker crust</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>

            <li> Combine condensed milk, key lime juice, sour cream, and lime 
                zest in a bowl; mix well. Pour into graham cracker crust; place 
                pie on a baking sheet. </li>

            <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 8 minutes, until tiny pinhole 
                bubbles burst on the surface of the pie. The filling will be wobbly 
                but not browned. </li>

            <li> Transfer pie to a wire rack to cool, then thoroughly chill pie in 
                the refrigerator before serving, about 1 hour. Garnish with lime 
                slices and whipped cream, if desired. </li>
        </ol>
