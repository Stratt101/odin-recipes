        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons lime juice</li>

            <li>⅓ cup milk</li>

            <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>

            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>

            <li>1 egg</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons lime zest</li>

            <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>

            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the 2 
                teaspoons of lime juice with the milk, let stand for 5 minutes. </li>

            <li> In a large bowl, cream together the butter and 3/4 cup sugar 
                until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, then stir in the lime 
                zest and milk mixture. Combine the flour, baking powder and baking 
                soda, blend into the creamed mixture. Drop by rounded spoonfuls 
                onto the ungreased cookie sheets. </li>

            <li> Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges 
                are light brown. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 5 
                minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>

            <li> To make the glaze, stir together the remaining lime juice and 
                sugar. Brush onto cooled cookies. </li>
        </ol>
